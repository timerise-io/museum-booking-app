# Museum Booking App

This is the repository for the "Museum Booking App," a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). This application demonstrates how to build a museum booking system using Next.js and the Timerise API.

## Tutorial

For a detailed guide on how this application was built, visit our tutorial: [Building a Museum Booking App with Next.js and Timerise API](https://timerise.io/tutorial-building-a-museum-booking-app-with-next-js-and-timerise-api/). The tutorial covers everything from setting up the project to deploying it with Vercel, making it a great resource for both beginners and experienced developers.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
